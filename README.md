# Lunch
 Each of the friends chooses a number, having a way to ensure that all chosen numbers are different. Then, they randomly choose a number. Whoever has wins choose the number greater than or equal to the number fixed. If everyone chose numbers above the fixed number, on that day no one is entitled to free lunch
